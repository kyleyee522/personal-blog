# Personal Blog

## Description

- THe personal blog website allows a user to create blog posts by filling out the form on the landing page. After filling ou the form completely, the user will then be redirected to the blogs posts page where they will be able to see all of the posted blogs. Additionally, the user will be able to switch the theme of the website from light mode to dark mode and vice versa.

* This project was created to help utilize HTML and CSS and also the local storage. Local storage was used to store items such as different blog posts and to tell whether the user's page is in dark or light mode. By putting these items in local storage, it would be possible to retrieve all of these items. In addition, local storage was used to make sure these items persisted when the user opens up the website again or if they refresh the page.
